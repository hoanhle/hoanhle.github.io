Hi I'm Hoanh. I like building cool stuff with smart people.

My background is a ML/AI Engineer with 5+ years of experience in various computer vision tasks. 
I'm currently working at an [A.I unicorn](https://www.scandit.com/) in Zurich, Switzerland, under [Lukas Bossard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukas-bossard/) (prev [Luis Haug](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luis-haug/), [Mattia Desana](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattia-desana-a475a660/)), the other time ideally i like to spend on my research in [Deep Learning Research group](https://research.cs.aalto.fi/bayes/) with supervision of [Sam Spilsbury](https://www.sspilsbury.com/research/)

At [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en), I'm studying my master in Machine Learning, Data Science, and Artificial Intelligence with a minor in Financial Engineering. You can check out my talk [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14J_zoI--lvcYtJH-wSM1QD56NLlm9mbt/edit#slide=id.g277ae8fd007_0_14). Before that, I spent most of my time doing competitive mathematics at national & internation levels at [Hanoi Amsterdam High School for the Gifted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanoi_%E2%80%93_Amsterdam_High_School).

In my free time, I travel and play tennis. I hope to compete sometimes soon, maybe in 1-2 years.

Thanks for visiting, please reach out with any question at contact@hoanh.ai. Iâ€™m always open to interesting conversations and collaboration.
